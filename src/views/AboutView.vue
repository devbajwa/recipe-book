      <p>This web app has been crafted as part of a learning journey, and while I've put my best effort into creating a
        functional and enjoyable experience, it comes with a few important disclaimers:</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Educational purpose</h2>
      <p>This project is primarily <strong>a learning exercise</strong>.<br />While it might showcase some good features,
        it's not intended
        for
        commercial use or as a fully polished, production-ready application.</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Limited functionality</h2>
      <p>The app might lack some advanced functionalities.</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Security consideration</h2>
      <p>Although I've taken steps to implement security best practices, this app might not adhere to the same level of
        scrutiny as production-ready applications.<br />Use it cautiously!</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Ongoing development</h2>
      <p>Learning is a journey, not a destination.<br />This app might undergo updates, improvements, and changes as I
        continue to learn and refine my skills.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Feedback welcome</h2>
      <p>More than happy to receive any feedback, suggestions or thoughts.<br />Thanks for understanding and joining us
        on this learning adventure! ðŸš€</p>
